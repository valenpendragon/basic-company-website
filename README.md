# Basic Company Website

This program is designed to showcase how Streamlit can very quickly produce a usable company website.

Included are two pages. The first is a combination of blurb and organization. The second is a Contact Page.

This program is suitable for small companies and organizations.

It requires a spreadsheet with the company employees and a text file with the blurb.

The field structure of each row of data.csv or data.xlsx must be:
1. first name
2. last name
3. role
4. image

These must be included in the header row as well.

All company images need to be stored in a subdirectory, images.
